# Text-Recommendation using Cosine Similarity Threshold

# Dataset Information

    This is a sample dataset that consists of key information on which type of News/Article each user likes or wishes to read about. The data is gathered by users activities on a particular app and based on the dataset recorded, we could recommend personalized feeds or articles.

    The Dataset contains the following parameters:

        * userId: Unique User ID for each user
        * Post-visibility: Whether the Data is posted 'public' or 'private'
        * description: The news or article content
        * Like: Liked post that's unique for each User
        * Dislike: If the user doesn't like to read about a particular topic 
        * Comments: The User's comments on each news/article

# Text similarity identification using Cosine Similarity

    Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space. Each words are converted as vectors in-order to identify near accurate similarities among the articles in the database. It is measured by the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. It is used to measure document similarity in text analysis and in most of the Natural Language Processing tasks.The Threshold could be adjusted to alter the recommendation filteration that is required for each application.
